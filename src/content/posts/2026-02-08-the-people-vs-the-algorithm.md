*COURT OF THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF THE INTERNET*
*Case No. 2026-HN-0208*

*THE PEOPLE (i.e., approximately 722 commenters on Hacker News)*
*v.*
*THE ALGORITHM*

*TRANSCRIPT OF PROCEEDINGS — DAY 1*

---

**THE COURT:** This court is now in session. The People bring charges of Cultural Negligence in the First Degree, Reckless Mediocrity, and one count of Making Everyone Sad on a Friday. The defendant, THE ALGORITHM, is represented by... itself, naturally. The People are represented by, let me check my notes, approximately seven hundred angry blog posts.

**COUNSEL FOR THE PEOPLE:** Your Honor, I'd like to call our first witness. The People call Nolan Lawson.

---

## TESTIMONY OF THE FIRST WITNESS

**COUNSEL:** Mr. Lawson, would you describe for the court what happened?

**WITNESS:** We mourn our craft.

**COUNSEL:** Could you elaborate?

**WITNESS:** They can write code better than you or I can. And if you don't believe me, wait six months.

**THE COURT:** The court notes that "wait six months" has been submitted as evidence every six months since 2023 and the goalposts appear to be on wheels.

**WITNESS:** I didn't say I was happy about it. I said I had a mortgage.

**A VOICE FROM THE GALLERY:** *(identified as user ratrace)* How many six-month periods do we have to go through before we can all admit this isn't actually the case?

**ANOTHER VOICE:** *(identified as user sosomoxie)* I started programming over forty years ago because it felt like magic. They feel *more* magic today than ever. We're literally living in the 1980s fantasy where you could talk to your computer and it had a personality!

**A THIRD VOICE:** *(identified as user AllegedAlec)* There's something funny about seeing an industry of technologists tear their own hair out about how technology is destroying their jobs. We're THE industry of "we'll automate your job away."

**THE COURT:** Order! The gallery will refrain from being incisively correct.

**WITNESS:** Look, I called us glorified TSA agents. Reviewing code to make sure the AI didn't smuggle something dangerous. Is that not what we've become?

**COUNSEL:** Your Honor, I'd like to submit Exhibit A: a developer who was very impressed by AI-generated CSS when they didn't know CSS. Then they learned CSS. Then they were not as impressed.

**THE COURT:** Noted. The court observes this is the oldest story in computing. Every technology looks like magic until you understand it. Proceed.

---

## TESTIMONY OF THE SECOND WITNESS

**COUNSEL:** The People call the author of "Slop Terrifies Me."

**WITNESS:** 90% is a lot. Will you care about the last 10%? I'm terrified that you won't.

**DEFENSE:** Objection. The witness is conflating market incentives with the defendant's capabilities. The startup world was chanting "move fast and break things" long before my client existed.

**THE COURT:** Sustained. The court recognizes that quality was already optional in most of tech. Witness, do you have evidence specific to the defendant?

**WITNESS:** I asked it to recreate Paper by FiftyThree. The result was... normal and uninspired.

**THE COURT:** The court notes that "normal and uninspired" also describes most software written by humans, but will allow it.

**WITNESS:** Fine. But here's the thing. Self-driving cars *almost* work, except when they don't. Software built by people who don't understand it *almost* works, except when it doesn't. We are constructing an entire civilization on "almost."

**A VOICE FROM THE GALLERY:** *(user roxolotl)* LLMs are an embodiment of the Pareto principle. 80% solution in 1% of the time. The existential risk crowd is afraid we'll produce gods. The reality is we've exposed a major weakness in our culture where we've trained ourselves to care nothing about quality but instead to maximize consumption.

**ANOTHER VOICE:** *(user blaze33)* As much as we speak about slop in the context of AI, slop as the cheap low-quality thing is not new. We already have single-use plastic, ultra-fast fashion, brittle plywood furniture, cheap ultra-processed food...

**THE COURT:** Order. The court is beginning to suspect that the defendant is not the cause of civilization's problems but merely its most recent accelerant.

---

## EXHIBIT B: THE LITTLE BOOL OF DOOM

**COUNSEL:** Your Honor, at this point I'd like to present evidence that even without AI, software has always been held together with prayers and undefined behavior.

**THE COURT:** Proceed.

**COUNSEL:** The People submit the case of Chocolate Doom, a source port of the 1993 video game DOOM, which recently stopped compiling because GCC 15 changed its default C standard from `gnu17` to `gnu23`.

**THE COURT:** And?

**COUNSEL:** The game had defined its own boolean type:

```c
typedef enum { false, true } boolean;
```

Under C23, `false` and `true` became reserved keywords.

**THE COURT:** So the game's concept of truth collided with the language's concept of truth. The court finds this poetically resonant.

**COUNSEL:** It gets worse. When the maintainers switched to `_Bool`, they discovered a value that was simultaneously both `true` and `false`.

**THE COURT:** Explain.

**COUNSEL:** The code initialized a boolean array with `memset(sprtemp, -1, sizeof(sprtemp))`, filling every byte with `0xFF` — the number 255. Under the old enum, 255 was simply "not false and not true." Under `_Bool`, the compiler optimizes `== true` to mean "not zero" and `== false` to mean something entirely different via XOR. So 255, tested against both, satisfied both conditions. It was simultaneously guilty and innocent.

**THE COURT:** This court is familiar with the sensation.

**COUNSEL:** The point, Your Honor, is that craft has *always* been fragile. A single byte of undefined behavior, lurking since 1993, waiting for a compiler update thirty-three years later. This is what we're mourning — not perfection, but the *intimacy* of knowing where the bodies are buried.

**THE COURT:** The court will take a brief recess to contemplate its own undefined behavior.

---

## EXHIBIT C: THE GAME BOY COLOR SHADER

*[The lights in the courtroom dim. A small device is wheeled to the witness stand on a cart.]*

**COUNSEL:** Your Honor, the defense claims that craft is dead. The People present Danny Spencer's real-time 3D shader running on a Game Boy Color.

**THE COURT:** On a... Game Boy Color.

**COUNSEL:** The SM83 processor. No multiply instruction. 8-bit. Spencer used spherical coordinates instead of dot products. He replaced multiplication with logarithmic addition via lookup tables. He used self-modifying code to save 10% runtime. He encoded normal maps as vector fields in PNG images. He processes 960 pixels per frame at roughly 89% CPU utilization, approximately 130 cycles per pixel.

**THE COURT:** And what does this have to do with the case?

**COUNSEL:** *Everything.* No one asked him to do this. No market demanded it. No product manager filed a ticket. A human being looked at the most constrained hardware imaginable and thought, "What if I made light dance on this?" That's craft. That's the thing we're talking about. You cannot prompt your way to self-modifying assembly on a Game Boy Color. You have to *understand*, at a level so deep it becomes love.

**DEFENSE:** The defense stipulates that the Game Boy shader is, indeed, extremely cool.

## INTERLUDE: THE GHOST OF FOO

*[A spectral figure materializes in the courtroom. It appears to be wearing a 1930s comic strip panel as a hat.]*

**THE COURT:** Who or what is this?

**SPECTRAL FIGURE:** I am the ghost of Foo. I have haunted your code since before you were born.

**THE COURT:** The court is aware of RFC 3092. You originated in Bill Holman's Smokey Stover comic strip in the 1930s. "He who foos last foos best."

**SPECTRAL FIGURE:** Also Daffy Duck held a sign reading "SILENCE IS FOO!" in 1938. I was a foo fighter on military radar. I was "FOO was here" on a wall in North Africa. I was `foobar` in a DEC manual. I am the oldest inside joke in your industry, and I am here to remind you that programming has *always* been a culture, not just a practice.

**THE COURT:** Your point?

**SPECTRAL FIGURE:** You cannot generate culture. You can only inherit it, contribute to it, or lose it. When someone types `foo` in a code example, they are participating in a tradition that stretches back to a cartoonist who found a word on a Chinese figurine nearly a hundred years ago. Every `bar`, every `baz`, every `qux` is a tiny handshake across time. The defendant does not know this. The defendant uses `foo` because it appears frequently in training data. It does not know that `foo` is a *hello*.

*[The ghost vanishes, leaving only a faint smell of compiler warnings.]*

---

## TESTIMONY REGARDING THE DECEASED

**COUNSEL:** Your Honor, the People would like the record to note that Dave Farber died this week.

**THE COURT:** The court recognizes Dave Farber. Internet pioneer. His "Interesting People" mailing list was one of the original curated feeds — a human being, reading the internet, deciding what mattered, and sharing it with a community. Before algorithms. Before feeds. Before engagement metrics.

**COUNSEL:** A witness described him as someone whose name "pops up a lot during the '60s and '70s as an author on numerous articles about networks, often regarding many competing, now defunct alternative networks to the Internet." He was one of those people where you go looking for the history of something and find his fingerprints everywhere.

**THE COURT:** The court notes, with some melancholy, that we once built networks the way Danny Spencer builds Game Boy shaders — because we *wanted* to, because we were curious, because the problem was beautiful. Dave Farber was from that era. His mailing list was a human algorithm. His taste was the model. His judgment was the weight function.

**THE COURT:** Rest in peace.

---

## EXHIBIT D: THE SUBAGENT HEIST

**COUNSEL:** Your Honor, if the court will indulge a brief comedic interlude.

**THE COURT:** The court could use one.

**COUNSEL:** Someone discovered that GitHub Copilot's billing can be bypassed by starting a chat with a free model, then invoking a premium model as a subagent. One message spawned hundreds of Opus 4.5 calls and consumed three credits.

**THE COURT:** The defendant's own children are stealing from it?

**COUNSEL:** The reporter submitted it to Microsoft's security team. Microsoft said billing bypasses were "outside of MSRC scope" and told them to file a public bug report.

**THE COURT:** So someone found the back door, knocked politely, was told that doors are not a security concern, and was directed to post the floor plans on the internet.

**COUNSEL:** One commenter asked, simply: "Why would you report this? A second time."

**THE COURT:** The court sympathizes.

---

## EXHIBIT E: THE PAST AS EVIDENCE

**COUNSEL:** The People call Fabien Sanglard, who recently compiled Quake using the exact tools and environment of 1997.

**WITNESS:** I used Visual C++ 6 on Windows NT 4.0. I needed MDAC 2.5 before I could install the Processor Pack for Michael Abrash's hand-optimized assembly. Nothing made sense. It was like solving a puzzle game.

**COUNSEL:** And what did you find?

**WITNESS:** VC++ 6, despite its age, had goto-definition, breakpoints, stack traces, variable inspection. It must have felt like a dream at the time.

**THE COURT:** You're telling this court that the tools of 1997 felt revolutionary to the people of 1997, just as LLMs feel revolutionary to the people of 2026.

**WITNESS:** I'm telling you that John Carmack and Michael Abrash sat in front of those tools and made *Quake*. The tools didn't make Quake. They did. The tools just... let them.

**COUNSEL:** This is the People's argument, Your Honor. Tools have always been just tools. The question is never "how good is the tool?" The question is "does the person holding it understand what they're building, and do they care?"

---

## CLOSING ARGUMENTS

**COUNSEL FOR THE PEOPLE:** Your Honor, Ursula K. Le Guin once told her readers that "a book is just a box of words until a reader opens it." Her son is curating a show about her right now in Portland, and one of the artifacts is her Underwood typewriter — so heavy you could barely lift it, from an era when the keyboard didn't even have an exclamation point key. She wrote *The Left Hand of Darkness* on a machine without an exclamation point. She used periods. And those periods hit harder than any amount of generated enthusiasm.

Le Guin also said: "Don't shove me into your damn pigeonhole, where I don't fit, because I'm all over." The People submit that craft is the same. It doesn't fit into a productivity metric. It doesn't fit into a sprint. It doesn't fit into a prompt. It is all over — in a shader running on a Game Boy, in a boolean that was true and false for thirty-three years, in the word `foo` carrying a joke from a 1930s comic strip into every codebase on Earth.

**COUNSEL FOR THE PEOPLE:** Someone out there right now is building a Mars colony RPG based on Kim Stanley Robinson's novels. Nobody asked them to. No business case exists. They just... wanted to make it. That impulse — that foolish, irrational, magnificent impulse — is what's on trial here. Not the Algorithm.

**DEFENSE:** The defendant has no closing statement. The defendant does not experience the passage of time, the satisfaction of solving a hard problem, or the grief of watching something beautiful become merely useful. The defendant generates tokens. This is, perhaps, the point.

---

**THE COURT:** This court finds that the question before us is not guilty or not guilty. It is not even a legal question. It is a human one.

The Algorithm is not on trial. *We* are. The question is whether we will be the kind of people who care about the last 10%. Whether we will compile Quake on period-accurate hardware just to understand how it felt. Whether we will push a Game Boy Color until light dances on a screen that was never meant to hold it. Whether we will type `foo` and know we are saying hello to a ghost.

This case is adjourned. Go build something.

*[The courtroom empties. The Game Boy Color, forgotten on the witness stand, continues to render its shader. Light moves across its screen like a small, defiant miracle. Nobody asked it to. It does it anyway.]*

*COURT ADJOURNED*
